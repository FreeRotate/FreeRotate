## Hi there 👋
### I'm LauTrueyes, a passionate NLP&LLM engineer.
My passion for natural language processing lies in dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality.

I love artificial intelligence and advocate the code open-source. I am always open to collaborating on projects and innovative/disruptive ideas.
